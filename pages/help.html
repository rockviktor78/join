          <h2>What is Join?</h2>
          <p>
            <a href="#">Join</a> is a kanban-based project management tool
            developed by a group of motivated students during their web
            development bootcamp at the <strong>Developer Akademie</strong>.
          </p>

          <p>
            Kanban is a method that focuses on visualizing work and tracking
            progress in a clear and structured way.
            <a href="#">Join</a> applies these principles to provide an
            intuitive interface that helps users plan tasks, monitor progress,
            and stay organized throughout a project.
          </p>

          <p>
            Please note that <a href="#">Join</a> is an educational project. It
            was created for learning purposes and is not intended for
            professional or large-scale business use. While we aim to provide a
            smooth user experience, we cannot guarantee permanent availability,
            reliability, or complete accuracy.

        <div class="help-section">
          <h2>How to use Join</h2>
          <p>
            Getting started with <a href="#">Join</a> is simple. The following
            steps will guide you through the basic features.
          </p>

          <h3>The Board Overview</h3>
          <p>
            After logging in, you will see a default kanban board that
            represents your project. The board consists of four columns:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>To Do</strong></li>
            <li><strong>In Progress</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Await Feedback</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Done</strong></li>
          </ul>
          <p>Each column represents a different stage of your tasks.</p>

          <h3>Managing Contacts</h3>
          <p>
            <a href="#">Join</a> allows you to collaborate with others by adding
            contacts. To create a new contact, go to the
            <strong>Contacts</strong> section, click on
            <strong>New contact</strong>, and enter the required information.
            Once added, contacts can be assigned to tasks and take part in the
            project workflow.
          </p>

          <h3>Creating Tasks</h3>
          <p>
            Tasks in <a href="#">Join</a> are displayed as cards on the board.
            You can add a new task by clicking the <strong>"+"</strong> button
            in the appropriate column. Each card can include details such as the
            task title, description, due date, and assigned contacts.
          </p>

          <h3>Updating Task Status</h3>
          <p>
            As work progresses, tasks can be moved between columns using drag
            and drop. This makes it easy to track progress and keep the board up
            to date.
          </p>

          <h3>Completing or Deleting Tasks</h3>
          <p>
            When a task is finished, move it to the
            <strong>Done</strong> column. If a task is no longer needed, it can
            be deleted. Please note that deleted tasks are removed permanently
            and cannot be restored.
          </p>

        <div class="help-section">
          <h2>Final Notes</h2>
          <p>
            <a href="#">Join</a> works best when tasks are updated regularly.
            Keeping the board current ensures that everyone involved has a clear
            understanding of the project's status.
