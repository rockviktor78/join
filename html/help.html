          <h2>What is Join?</h2>
          <p>
            <span class="brand-name">Join</span> is a kanban-based project
            management tool designed and built by a group of dedicated students
            as part of their web development bootcamp at the
            <span class="company-name">Developer Akademie</span>.
          </p>

          <p>
            Kanban, a Japanese term meaning "billboard", is a highly effective
            method to visualize work, limit work-in-progress, and maximize
            efficiency (or flow). <span class="brand-name">Join</span> leverages
            the principles of kanban to help users manage their tasks and
            projects in an intuitive, visual interface.
          </p>

          <h2>How to use it</h2>
          <p>
            Here is a step-by-step guide on how to use
            <span class="brand-name">Join</span>:
          </p>

          <ol class="help-steps">
            <li>
              <h3>Exploring the Board</h3>
              <p>
                When you log in to <span class="brand-name">Join</span>, you'll
                find a default board. This board represents your project and
                contains four default lists: "To Do", "In Progress", "Await
                feedback" and "Done".
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <h3>Creating Contacts</h3>
              <p>
                In <span class="brand-name">Join</span>, you can add contacts to
                collaborate on your projects. Go to the "Contacts" section,
                click on "New contact", and fill in the required information.
                Once added, these contacts can be assigned tasks and they can
                interact with the tasks on the board.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <h3>Adding Cards</h3>
              <p>
                Now that you've added your contacts, you can start adding cards.
                Cards represent individual tasks. Click the "+" button under the
                appropriate list to create a new card. Fill in the task details
                in the card, like task name, description, due date, assignees,
                etc.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <h3>Moving Cards</h3>
              <p>
                As work progresses, you can move cards from one list to another
                to reflect their current status. Simply drag and drop the card
                to the appropriate column.
              </p>
